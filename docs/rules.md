Game Rules
==========

I fear we'll need to find some well-tested rules somewhere and stick
with them.

Orders of magnitude
-------------------

Stat increases are exponential while requirement increases are
polynomial (e.g. it takes 10% more XP to level up again, but your
stats are all doubled).

Calculations take into account your HP (you get deal more damage and
and get more XP if you're running low on HP).

There are such things as criticals (^2 damage), super-criticals (^4
damage) and limit breaks (^8 damage). Criticals are fairly common,
super-criticals, less so. Limit breaks can only be done when HP < 5%.

Team zapping
------------

I am a big fan of the team zapping system used in early Resident Evil
games.

I think each of the main characters should see the world differently.
Alex sees a pessimistic realism.  Max is Kamina, of course. This is
effectively replay levels on different "planes", BUT the repercussions
of character's actions on the world should be felt by the others.
