Super Max (story)
=================

Prelude
-------

The Professor had a bad feeling about this.  He wanted to say
something out loud, to say that he'd been against it from the
beginning, but there was no point to that now.  He saw only one course
of action that could salvage the situation:

"We need to reverse the polarity!", the Professor shouted over the
deafening roar of the Apparatus.

"That doesn't make sense", replied the Assistant from somewhere deep
inside the machine.

The Professor began to say something, but was cut short when the
infernal noise suddenly ceased.

"Is it over?", he inquired towards the now lifeless husk of the
machine.

"No", replied the Assistant, removing himself from the inert metal.
"No, that Thing has escaped.  It's only just began."

Relics
------

The following relics are scattered around Kingdom College:

  - Occam's Razor :: this battle-axe is located deep inside the Math
                     department; it deals critical damage to Rube
                     Goldberg automatons; ``You carefully size up the
                     weapon and find that understanding its purpose
                     requires no assumptions on your part.'';

  - Uncertainty ::

Characters
----------

The following characters may be encountered in Kingdom College (these
are the ones with back-stories):

  - The Professor/The Assistant :: ``Everybody calls him barkeep''.
       The enigmatic professor and his assistant are intimately
       connected to The Incident.  Their memories, of both before and
       after, are scattered throughout the departments.  The fallout
       of their various attempts to fix the problem are also found
       everywhere.

Notes
-----

I think each of the main characters should see the world differently.
Alex sees a pessimistic realism.  Max is Kamina, of course.
